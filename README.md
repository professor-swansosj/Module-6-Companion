# Module 6 Companion - Webhooks & Event-Driven Network Automation

## Software Defined Networking Course

> **Welcome to Event-Driven Automation!** Get ready to discover how networks can automatically respond to events in real-time. You'll build your own webhook server using FastAPI and see how devices can "talk back" to your applications when something interesting happens.

## 🎯 What You'll Practice

By the end of this companion, you'll have the skills to:

- **Build webhook servers** that listen for network events
- **Create API endpoints** using modern FastAPI framework  
- **Integrate external services** to enrich your automation workflows
- **Automate network tasks** triggered by real-time events
- **Configure Cisco devices** to send webhook notifications

## 🗂 Learning Path

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours of hands-on practice

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Take your time with each section. Experiment! Break things! That's how you really learn.

### Companion Section Progression

| Section | Focus Area | What You'll Build |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **01** | 🏁 **FastAPI Basics** | Understand webhooks & setup your environment |
| **02** | 🖥️ **First Server** | Launch your first FastAPI server |
| **03** | 🛤️ **Paths & Fun** | Create multiple endpoints with ASCII art |
| **04** | 🌐 **External APIs** | Connect to Dad Jokes API (yes, really!) |
| **05** | 🔌 **Network Ops** | Control network devices via webhooks |
| **06** | ⚡ **Cisco Events** | Configure EDM applets for real automation |

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Clone and navigate:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Module-6-Companion
   ```

2. **Create your Python environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv webhook-env
   # Windows:
   webhook-env\Scripts\activate
   # Mac/Linux:
   source webhook-env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the magic:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🎯 Practice Callouts

This companion is your **coding playground**. We don't give you complete solutions - we give you the pieces and guide you to build something awesome!

### How Each Section Works

- **📖 Learn**: Quick intro to the concept

- **🚀 Extend**: Ideas to go further

## 🚀 Getting Hands-On

1. **Start here:** Read this entire README
2. **Then go to:** `01_fastapi_intro/` - Your first steps with webhooks
3. **Progress through:** Each numbered module in order
4. **Need help?** Check the hints in each module's README

## 😃 What Makes This Fun

- **Real network automation** - Your code will control actual devices
- **Instant feedback** - See your webhook server respond in real-time  
- **Practical skills** - Build tools you'll use in the real world
- **Creative freedom** - Customize and extend beyond the basics

## 🆘 Getting Help

Stuck? That's part of learning! Try this sequence:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - Python tells you what's wrong
2. **Check the module hints** - We've included troubleshooting tips
3. **Experiment with small changes** - Sometimes the solution is simpler than you think
4. **Ask for help** - Your instructor and classmates are here to support you

## 🏆 Success Criteria

You'll know you're succeeding when:

- [x] Your FastAPI server starts without errors
- [x] You can access the interactive API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- [x] Your endpoints respond with expected data
- [x] You can trigger network commands via webhook calls
- [x] You understand how events can trigger automation
