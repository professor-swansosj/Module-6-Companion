# 🚀 Module 6 Companion - Webhooks & Event-Driven Network Automation

Welcome to your hands-on exploration of **Webhooks** and **Event-Driven Automation**! Get ready to discover how networks can automatically respond to events in real-time. You'll build your own webhook server using FastAPI and see how devices can "talk back" to your applications when something interesting happens.

## 🎯 What You'll Master

By the end of this companion, you'll have the skills to:

- **Build webhook servers** that listen for network events
- **Create API endpoints** using modern FastAPI framework  
- **Integrate external services** to enrich your automation workflows
- **Automate network tasks** triggered by real-time events
- **Configure Cisco devices** to send webhook notifications

## 🗺️ Your Learning Journey

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours of hands-on practice

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Take your time with each module. Experiment! Break things! That's how you really learn.

### Module Progression

| Module | Focus Area | What You'll Build |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **01** | 🏁 **FastAPI Basics** | Understand webhooks & setup your environment |
| **02** | 🖥️ **First Server** | Launch your first FastAPI server |
| **03** | 🛤️ **Paths & Fun** | Create multiple endpoints with ASCII art |
| **04** | 🌐 **External APIs** | Connect to Dad Jokes API (yes, really!) |
| **05** | 🔌 **Network Ops** | Control network devices via webhooks |
| **06** | ⚡ **Cisco Events** | Configure EDM applets for real automation |

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Do This First!)

1. **Clone and navigate:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Module-6-Companion
   ```

2. **Create your Python environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv webhook-env
   # Windows:
   webhook-env\Scripts\activate
   # Mac/Linux:
   source webhook-env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the magic:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
